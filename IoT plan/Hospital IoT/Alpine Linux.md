# Alpine Linux

Alpine Linux is a lightweight, security-oriented Linux distribution designed for users who value simplicity, efficiency, and reliability. It is widely used in embedded systems, containers, and virtualization environments.

## Key Characteristics
- **Lightweight**: The base installation is extremely small, typically around 5 MB, which makes it suitable for systems with limited resources.  
- **Security-focused**: Built with security in mind, using hardened kernels and relying on musl libc and BusyBox, which reduce the attack surface compared to larger Linux distributions.  
- **Resource efficient**: Consumes minimal CPU and memory, making it ideal for running in virtual machines, Docker containers, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  
- **Package management**: Uses the `apk` package manager, a fast and simple tool for installing, upgrading, and managing software packages.  

## Common Use Cases
- **Containers**: Often chosen as the base image in Docker because of its small size and speed.  
- **Virtualization**: Suitable for virtual machines on platforms such as Oracle VirtualBox thanks to its low footprint.  
- **Security projects**: Frequently used in penetration testing environments and IoT simulations where efficiency and simplicity are important.  
- **Servers**: Provides a minimal, stable foundation for microservices and cloud-native applications.  

## Role in the Project
In the IoT Intrusion Detection System project, Alpine Linux is used to represent medical devices such as MRI machines, infusion pumps, X-ray machines, and heart monitors. The reasons for choosing Alpine Linux include:  
- Its very small size and quick deployment.  
- The ability to simulate real medical devices without requiring powerful hardware.  
- A simple and reproducible environment for testing cybersecurity scenarios.
